# Eyeball_tracking
Eye tracking refers to the process of measuring the movements and positions of the eyes, usually with the help of specialized equipment. Eye tracking technology is used in a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, marketing, and human-computer interaction.

There are several different techniques for tracking eye movements. One common approach is to use a video-based system that records the position of the eyes relative to the head. This is done by tracking the position of the pupil and the reflections of infrared light that are emitted by the eye.

Eye tracking can be used to study a wide range of phenomena, including visual perception, attention, reading, and language processing. It is also used in the design of user interfaces, to help ensure that interfaces are easy to use and that users can quickly find the information they need.

Eye tracking can also be used in medical settings, for example to diagnose and monitor eye diseases and conditions.
